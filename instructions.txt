********************** BASICS ****************************************

example PDF:

******************
*                *
*   name: Jon    *
*                *
******************

In this PDF, the field is "name" and the value is "Jon"

The purpose of this script is to read through PDFs, find values, and write
them to a CSV file.

example CSV:

-------------------------
|file	|name	  	|
|	|	  	|
|pdf1   |Gary	  	|
|pdf2   |Amy	  	|
|pdf3  	|Howard   	|
|pdf4   |John Wick	|
-------------------------

******************** INSTALL *************************************

Python (at least version 3) is required to run the script

In addition, PyPDF2 is a Python library that must be
installed. To use the user interface, Pygame is another
library that must be installed.

This script was created and tested on Python v3.10.8,
PyPDF2 v2.11.1, and Pygame v2.1.2

Installing Python and libraries are best explained in videos.


******************* HOW TO USE ************************************

First, beside the extractor, in a folder called "pdfs", put all the PDF files you want scanned

Next, the extractor needs a list of fields to look for in each PDF. To do this, run "gui.py".
This is the user interface that will help you enter the fields.
	
Press the "+" button to add a new field. Fields can be selected, edited,
deleted, and you can drag them to change their order.

The "clear" button will remove all fields

After you have all the fields in place, you can press the "save" button to
save all the fields in a text file. That way, if you need to use the same
list of fields in the future, simply press the "load" button and find the text file.
You can also drag and drop text files containing fields

                 *** IMPORTANT ***
EVERY field in the pdf must be entered, IN ORDER.
Otherwise, there may be extraction inaccuracies

Once you are ready to start the extraction, press "done".

During extration, every PDF will be checked for the given list of fields.
Their associated values will be extracted and written to a CSV file.
Meanwhile, keep an eye on the console.
It will tell you information if something goes wrong.

Once a "Done!" appears in the console and everything looks good, your CSV file will automatically open.
