How to use:

The extractor can take a list of fields, find them in pdfs, and then provide the values on a csv file.

Place all your pdfs in the "pdfs" folder beside the exe.
When the program finishes, the csv file can be found beside the exe, and is called "output.csv".

To run, open "extractor.exe"
The user interface that opens can be used to create a list of fields that the program will look for.

To add a new field, press "enter" or press the "+" button on the toolbar.
Fields can be selected, changed, and deleted. You can also drag and drop to change the order.

The "clear" button will remove all the fields.

The "save" button will save all your current fields into a text file.
The "load" button will prompt you to select a text file, and then it'll add all the fields in that file.
Use these two buttons to save lists of field for future use.

--------------------------IMPORTANT-------------------------
EVERY field in the pdf must be entered, IN ORDER.
This is to help the program read duplicate fields, and to grab the correct values.

Once you are done with the fields, press the "done" button.
This will start the extraction.

Keep an eye on the console. It will tell you information if something goes wrong.
Once a "Done!" appears and everything looks good, your csv file will automatically open.
